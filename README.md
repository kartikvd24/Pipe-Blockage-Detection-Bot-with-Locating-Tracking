# Pipe Blockage Detection Bot with Locating & Tracking

This project is a real-time pipe blockage detection system using an ESP32-CAM module and YOLOv8 model with OpenCV. The bot can navigate inside pipelines, detect blockages using a trained object detection model, and send the live stream over Wi-Fi. The stream is processed on a local machine for real-time detection.

## 🧠 AI Model Used

- **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)**
  - Trained on a custom dataset containing images of clean and blocked pipelines.
  - Model detects blockage objects in real-time from the ESP32-CAM video feed.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Flash the ESP32-CAM**
   - Use Arduino IDE.
   - Select `AI Thinker ESP32-CAM` as the board.
   - Upload your ESP sketch (you can use a basic MJPEG stream sketch or a custom sketch that sends video stream over Wi-Fi).

2. **Get ESP32-CAM Stream URL**
   - After uploading the code, open the **Serial Monitor**.
   - Copy the IP address shown (e.g., `http://192.168.1.104`).

3. **Run Detection Script on Local PC**
   - Install Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Open `main.py` and replace the placeholder URL with the ESP32-CAM stream:

     ```python
     url = "http://192.168.x.x"  # Replace with your ESP32-CAM stream address
     ```

   - Run the script:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Output**
   - The script will open the video stream and apply YOLOv8 detection on the frames in real-time.
   - Detected blockages will be highlighted.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- NumPy
- ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure both your ESP32-CAM and your computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- This system can be extended by integrating a GPS module and uploading location data to a web server or Firebase.
